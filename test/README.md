# *test* Folder

The test folder contains integration and unit tests as defined in the OpenMSL [OSMP Test Architecture](https://github.com/openMSL/.github/blob/main/doc/osmp_test_architecture.md).

While unit tests test individual functions of the model, integration tests test the model in combination with other connected FMUs.
