# *src* Folder

The src folder contains the actual source code of the model.
In this template this folder has everything needed to build a sensor model FMU, based on the [OSI Sensor Model Packaging](https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/osi-sensor-model-packaging).
This example is based on the [OSMPDummySensor](https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/osi-sensor-model-packaging/tree/master/examples/OSMPDummySensor).
However, as a best practice, the model logic is separated from the packaging.
OSMP.cpp/.h contains the OSMP packaging and MySensorModel.cpp/.h contains the actual model logic.

Here is an overview over the files of this example:

| File                    | Description                                                                                                              |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CMakeLists.txt          | Contains the cmake instructions to build and package the model.                                                          |
| modelDescription.in.xml | Contains the input for the modelDescription.xml file packaged with every FMU. The actual xml file is generated by cmake. |
| MySensorModel.cpp/.h:   | These files contain the actual model source code.                                                                        |
| OSMP.cpp/.h:            | These files contain the OSMP packaging for the model.                                                                    |
